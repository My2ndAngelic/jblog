# Part 1
So basically there was a guy name "missing" askeed some math question. He then posted a curse screenshot with full of watermarks. The question was about calculating the area of the pool and volume of the pool given the diagonal and one side.

However, when I told him: "here is your figure of the pool" with a drawn diagonal, he simply refused to accept that and said: "I am not a teacher, I am a student. Only the teacher can make problem, student cannot make the problem. The pool does not have the diagonal so I cannot draw it. Pythagoras theorem is for triangle only, not for rectangle."

And then we then went back and forth until one of the mod, banned him because of trolling.

# Part 2
Now he used some alts to join and asked for his friend to be unbanned, claimed to be a 37 years old guy. Well, he keeps sending the same questions over and over again, like 4 times. 

This part, however, I tried my best to write it based on my memories.
